Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *string_nconcat(char *s1, char *s2, unsigned int n);
The returned pointer shall point to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains s1, followed by the first n bytes of s2, and null terminated
If the function fails, it should return NULL
If n is greater or equal to the length of s2 then use the entire string s2
if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string
